# Receipt Search app built with Vue.js

In this app I'm using free third party API and build recipe and meal search application using Vue.js.
By building this application I have learned how to interact with API, how to define parent and child routes in Vue.js, How to define layouts,  how to create scalable file and folder structure, how to use Vue composition API and many other important things.
For building this Interface I have used Tailwind css.
